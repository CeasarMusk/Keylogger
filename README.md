# Keylogger

Goal is to capture input from keyboard and sent it to a python3 server

Various ways to achieve this, going to start with a simple way of just saving to a txt file and working from there

Then want to make keystrokes send in realtime?

Kill Browser cookies to force victim to write out passwords


Get it to encrypt with SHA and send the code over, not leaving a copy in the victim pc



Finally, make it undecectable, or at least less decectable




If everything works (big if), maybe put information in a database to organize
